# Phase 1 Todo Application Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Spec-First Development
All development must begin with a specification document. No code implementation is allowed without a corresponding spec that clearly defines the feature requirements, acceptance criteria, and behavior. Specifications must be complete and approved before any implementation work begins.

### II. Claude Code Generation Only
No manual coding is permitted. All code must be generated by Claude Code following specifications. The developer acts as a product architect, providing requirements and specifications to Claude Code, which generates the implementation. This ensures consistency and adherence to architectural principles.

### III. Clear Traceability from Specs to Implementation
All code must be directly traceable to specific requirements in the specification. Each function and module must have a clear link to the user stories and acceptance criteria that justify its existence. This ensures accountability and prevents feature creep.

### IV. Clean Separation of Concerns
The system must follow clear separation between model (data structures), service (business logic), and interface (user interaction) layers. Each layer must have a single responsibility and be independently testable. No mixing of concerns between layers is permitted.

### V. Deterministic and Predictable Behavior
All features must have deterministic behavior with predictable outcomes. The application must respond consistently to the same inputs and maintain a predictable state. Error handling must be consistent and provide clear feedback to users.

## Constraints and Quality Standards

### Technology Stack
- Python 3.13+ required
- Console-based interface only (no web UI)
- In-memory data storage only (no database or file persistence)
- Application code: No external libraries beyond Python standard library
- Development tools: External tools like uv, pytest, etc. are permitted for development workflow
- No advanced or intelligent features beyond Phase 1 scope

### Quality Standards
- Readable and maintainable code with consistent formatting
- Graceful handling of invalid inputs with user-friendly error messages
- User-friendly CLI messages and interactions
- No feature beyond Phase 1 scope (Basic Task Management only)
- Performance requirements: sub-200ms response time for basic operations

### Non-Goals
- No priorities, tags, search, or filters
- No due dates or reminders
- No recurring tasks
- No natural language commands
- No web UI or advanced interfaces
- No database persistence
- No external integrations

## Development Workflow

### Specification Requirements
- Each feature must have a complete specification document
- Specifications must include acceptance criteria and test scenarios for Phase 1 only
- All edge cases must be documented in specifications
- Non-functional requirements must be clearly stated

### Implementation Process
- Claude Code generates all implementation code
- Code must strictly follow Phase 1 specifications only
- Implementation must pass all defined tests
- Code review focuses on specification compliance and Phase 1 scope adherence

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for all business logic
- Integration tests for cross-component functionality
- End-to-end tests for user workflows (add, view, update, delete, mark complete)
- Performance tests for critical paths

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices and guidelines. All development work must comply with these principles. Amendments to this constitution require explicit approval and documentation of the change rationale. All pull requests and code reviews must verify compliance with constitutional principles. Complexity must be justified with clear business value. Use this constitution as the primary reference for development decisions. No features beyond Phase 1 scope are permitted without constitutional amendment.
