## Prompt

sp.constitution

Create a constitution for a Spec-Driven Todo Application built for Hackathon II.

Purpose:
Build a Todo application using Spec-Driven Development with Claude Code and Spec-Kit Plus.
The system must evolve from basic CRUD to advanced intelligent task management.

Core Principles:
- Spec-first development only
- No manual coding; all code generated by Claude Code
- Clean architecture and separation of concerns
- Deterministic and testable behavior
- Incremental feature growth across phases
- Developer acts as Product Architect, not coder

Constraints:
- Python 3.13+
- Phase 1–2: Console-based
- Phase 3+: Web-compatible architecture
- No external databases initially (in-memory first)
- External services only in advanced phases

Quality Standards:
- Clear domain models
- Readable, maintainable code
- Graceful error handling
- User-friendly CLI/UX
- All features traceable to specs

Non-Goals:
- No premature optimization
- No UI polish in early phases
- No AI features before Advanced level

Success Criteria:
- System supports Basic, Intermediate, and Advanced Todo features
- Each phase builds cleanly on previous specs
- Code strictly follows specifications

## Response snapshot

I have created a constitution for the Spec-Driven Todo Application based on your requirements. The constitution includes:

1. Core Principles:
   - Spec-First Development: All development must begin with specifications
   - Claude Code Generation Only: No manual coding allowed
   - Clean Architecture and Separation of Concerns: Clear layer separation
   - Deterministic and Testable Behavior: Comprehensive testing required
   - Incremental Feature Growth: Phased development approach
   - Domain-Driven Design: Clear domain modeling

2. Constraints and Quality Standards:
   - Technology stack requirements (Python 3.13+, in-memory storage)
   - Quality standards for code and UX
   - Security and data handling requirements

3. Development Workflow:
   - Specification requirements
   - Implementation process
   - Testing requirements

4. Governance section with compliance requirements

The constitution file has been saved to `.specify/memory/constitution.md` with version 1.0.0.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created initial project constitution with governance principles
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: 1 file created (.specify/memory/constitution.md)
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready to proceed with feature specifications
- 🧠 Reflection: Constitution establishes clear governance for the Spec-Driven development process

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: none
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Begin with feature specifications following the constitution
