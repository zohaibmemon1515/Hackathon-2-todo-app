## Prompt

sp.constitution

Create a constitution for Phase 1 of a Spec-Driven Todo Application.

Purpose:
Implement Phase 1 (Basic Task Management) of a Todo Application using Spec-Driven Development with Claude Code and Spec-Kit Plus.

Phase 1 Goal:
Deliver a console-based MVP that allows users to add, view, update, delete, and mark tasks as complete.

Core Principles:
- Spec-first development only
- No manual coding; all code generated by Claude Code
- Clear traceability from specs to implementation
- Clean separation of concerns (model, service, interface)
- Deterministic and predictable behavior

Constraints:
- Python 3.13+
- Console-based interface only
- In-memory data storage
- No database or file persistence
- No external libraries
- No web UI
- No advanced or intelligent features

Quality Standards:
- Readable and maintainable code
- Graceful handling of invalid inputs
- User-friendly CLI messages
- No feature beyond Phase 1 scope

Non-Goals:
- No priorities, tags, search, or filters
- No due dates or reminders
- No recurring tasks
- No natural language commands

Success Criteria:
- All Phase-1 acceptance scenarios pass
- User can fully manage tasks from the terminal
- Application is demo-ready for Hackathon II

## Response snapshot

Updated the project constitution to focus specifically on Phase 1 requirements for the Todo Application. The constitution now emphasizes:

1. Core Principles focused on Phase 1:
   - Spec-first development
   - Claude Code generation only
   - Clear traceability from specs to implementation
   - Clean separation of concerns (model, service, interface)
   - Deterministic and predictable behavior

2. Constraints aligned with Phase 1:
   - Console-based interface only
   - In-memory data storage only
   - No external libraries beyond Python standard library
   - No advanced features beyond Phase 1 scope

3. Added Non-Goals section to clearly define what's out of scope:
   - No priorities, tags, search, or filters
   - No due dates or reminders
   - No recurring tasks
   - No natural language commands
   - No web UI or advanced interfaces

4. Updated version to 1.1.0 to reflect the amendment

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Updated constitution to focus on Phase 1 requirements
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: 1 file updated (.specify/memory/constitution.md)
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready to proceed with Phase 1 implementation
- 🧠 Reflection: Constitution now clearly defines Phase 1 scope and constraints

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: none
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Begin Phase 1 implementation following the updated constitution
