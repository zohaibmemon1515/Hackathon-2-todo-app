# Implementation Plan: Phase 1 Todo Application

**Branch**: `002-phase1-todo-app` | **Date**: 2025-12-29 | **Spec**: [specs/002-phase1-todo-app/spec.md](/mnt/e/Web Development/Governer Course/Q4/Hackhathon 2/python-todo-app/specs/002-phase1-todo-app/spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/002-phase1-todo-app/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/sp.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Implementation of a console-based todo application MVP that allows users to add, view, update, delete, and mark tasks as complete. The application follows a clean architecture with separation of concerns between models, services, and CLI interface. All data is stored in-memory only, with no persistence to files or databases. The implementation strictly adheres to Phase 1 specifications and avoids any out-of-scope features.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.13+ (as required by constitution)
**Primary Dependencies**: Python standard library only (no external dependencies as required by constitution)
**Development Tools**: uv package manager for development workflow (as per updated constitution)
**Storage**: In-memory only (no file/database persistence as required by constitution)
**Testing**: pytest (Python standard testing framework)
**Target Platform**: Console/terminal environment (as required by constitution)
**Project Type**: Single console application - determines source structure
**Performance Goals**: <200ms response time for basic operations (as required by constitution)
**Constraints**: <200ms p95 response time, console-based interface only, no external libraries, no features beyond Phase 1 scope
**Scale/Scope**: Single-user console application, up to 1000 tasks in memory

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- **Spec-First Development**: ✅ All development will follow the specification document created at specs/002-phase1-todo-app/spec.md
- **Claude Code Generation Only**: ✅ All code will be generated by Claude Code following specifications
- **Clear Traceability from Specs to Implementation**: ✅ Each function/module will link to specific requirements in the specification
- **Clean Separation of Concerns**: ✅ Architecture will follow clear separation between model (data structures), service (business logic), and interface (CLI) layers
- **Deterministic and Predictable Behavior**: ✅ All features will have deterministic behavior with predictable outcomes
- **Technology Stack Compliance**: ✅ Python 3.13+, console-based interface only, in-memory storage, no external libraries
- **Non-Goals Compliance**: ✅ No advanced features beyond Phase 1 scope (no priorities, tags, search, due dates, etc.)
- **Quality Standards**: ✅ Readable code, graceful error handling, user-friendly CLI messages

*POST-DESIGN CHECK: All constitutional requirements continue to be satisfied after Phase 1 design completion.*

**Structure Decision**: Single console application structure selected, with clear separation of concerns between models (data structures), services (business logic), repositories (data access), and CLI (user interface). This follows the clean architecture principles required by the constitution.
